# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI agent project called `assurance_ai_agent`. The repository is currently in early stages of development.

## Package Management

This project uses **Yarn 4.5.2** with Plug'n'Play (PnP) enabled.

### Key Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Add a new dependency
yarn add <package-name>

# Add a dev dependency
yarn add -D <package-name>

# Remove a dependency
yarn remove <package-name>
```

## Code Style

This project follows the EditorConfig standards:
- **Line endings**: LF
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces for JS, JSON, and YAML files
- **Charset**: UTF-8
- **Final newline**: Required

## Development Workflow

As this is an early-stage project, standard development patterns will be established as the codebase grows. When adding new features or making changes:

1. Ensure all code follows the EditorConfig settings
2. Maintain consistent naming conventions as they emerge
3. Keep the package.json updated with accurate dependencies

## Architecture Notes

The project architecture is still being defined. As the codebase develops, this section will be updated with:
- Core component structure
- Data flow patterns
- Integration points
- Key abstractions and interfaces

*This WARP.md file should be updated as the project architecture and development practices become established.*
